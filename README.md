# js-concepts
Either stuff I know or stuff I learn, I needed somewhere to stuff concepts and smaller experiments. That's here.

## react-router
Some simple experimets around Reacts router functionality

## rpc
Played around with specifically sending functions between nodes via rpc.

## react-update-array
Had some problems with handling arrays in a React form, so I needed to strip away all the other stuff to see what I was doing.

## react-jest
Needed to isolate some concepts around a react-jest-test. This one could be even smaller, I just copied a few files from another project.

## Vue hooks
My vue hooks didn't do what I wanted them to, so I created a project that only logs when each hook runs, just to have something to compare to

## Srcset
We discussed the srcset property of the img html element so I just felt I needed to do a simple test, just to make sure it was as simple as I thought. It was :).
